## Deploy the Portfolio

### With Docker

```shell
docker run -d --name prakash-portfolio -p 3000:3000 prakash-kafle/portfolio:1.0
```

### Without Docker

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Run the Production server:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Development

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Customizations Made

This portfolio has been extensively customized from the original template to reflect my professional experience:

- **Updated Content**: All sections updated with professional experience and projects
- **Technology Showcase**: Custom technology carousel featuring Java/Spring Boot stack
- **Project Portfolio**: Real projects from  experience including PDF processing systems, chat applications, and e-commerce platforms
- **Professional Timeline**: Experience at Elevance Health and educational background
- **Enhanced Animations**: Improved technology grid with smooth scrolling animations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
